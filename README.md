# GameOfWar
This repository is being created as a personal challenge to get an introduction to as many programming languages as possible. The reason for doing this challenge by creating a game is that War is difficult enough to require extensive learning, but not so difficult that implemetation of the algorithms will be difficult. Creating the game should give me enough experience in each language to be able to pick it up at any time and be able to work on it, even without having mastered the language.

## Game Rules
There may be different variations of the game that exist. Having acknowledged this, I will be creating my implementation of the game by following these rules:
- A shuffled 54 card deck will be divided between 2 players
- Jokers will beat all other cards
- Aces will beat all other face cards
- Two is the lowest valued card
- A tie will result in the players putting 3 cards each into a side pile and then showing another card. Winner takes the original cards, the side piles and the new cards.
- There can be a tie within a tie. If this happens, winner takes the cards from both (or all) side piles as well as all cards shown.
